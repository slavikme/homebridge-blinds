    }
```

### URL Configuration
---

#### Basic

You can omit any of the `up_url`, `down_url`, `stop_url` if you don't want these to send a command, and `position_url` if you want the blinds to only emulate the position (using a timer).

You can omit `http_method`, it defaults to `POST`. Note that it can also be configured to accept any number of additional arguments (headers, body, form, etc.) that [request](https://github.com/request/request) or [requestretry](https://github.com/FGRibreau/node-request-retry) supports.

`success_codes` allows you to define which HTTP response codes indicate a successful server response. If omitted, it defaults to 200.

`max_http_attempts` allows you to define a maximum number of retries on a failed or timed out request (retry on 5xx or network errors). If omitted, it defaults to 5. If no retries are desired, set this value to 1.

`retry_delay` allows you to define the number of ms between HTTP retries (`max_http_attempts` > 1). If omitted, it defaults to 2000 (2 seconds). The minimum number of ms has been set to 100 to avoid excessive requests.

#### Advanced

Alternatively, for more advanced configuration of URL's, each URL can be set to a complete `request`/`requestretry` object, e.g.:

```js
      "up_url": {
        "url": "http://1.2.3.4/window/up",
        "body": "{}",
        "headers": {
          "API-Token": "aaabbbcccddd"
        },
        "method": "PUT",
        "maxAttempts": 5,
        "retryDelay": 2000,
        "time": false
      },
```

If an object is used for the configuration, `http_method`, `max_http_attempts`, and `retry_delay` are ignored, and these values must be instead specified directly inside the object. `success_codes` are still used globally.

If `time` is set to true, a full request timing profile (wait, dns, tcp, firstByte, download, total) will be logged (see [timingPhases](https://github.com/request/request/blob/master/README.md)).

### Blinds position
---

The plugin emulates the blinds position (it saves it in a variable) using an understanding of how long the blinds take to move and the relative position, but it can be used with `position_url` for realtime feedback.

#### Sending specific/exact position (optional)

For `up_url` and `down_url`, the variable `%%POS%%` can be included in the URL, which will be replaced with the desired target before the URL is requested. For example, use of `http://1.2.3.4/window/up?pos=%%POS%%` would be modified to `http://1.2.3.4/window/up?pos=100` if the position 100 was requested. This is useful for cases where blinds offer the ability to directly specify the value.

When `%%POS%%` is used, note that `stop_url` will not be sent. (Because the blinds can receive a specific position, that there is no need to send an additional stop command.)


#### Receiving specific position (optional, ad hoc basis)

If the following parameters are defined, the position can be updated using a webhook. At a minimum, `webhook_port` must be defined. `webhook_http_auth_user` / `webhook_http_auth_pass` are used for basic authentication. If `webhook_https` is true, then an SSL connection is used instead. If `webhook_https_keyfile` / `webhook_https_keyfile` are not defined, a self-signed certificate will be used instead.

Once defined, this can be updated as follows: `http://homebridgeip:port/?pos=##`, where `pos=` any integer between 0-100. A simple JSON where `success` is true or false is returned. Additional information is returned in the logs.

For example, `http://192.168.1.40:51828/?pos=30`.

This implementation does take into account whether or not the blinds are moving, but will be most reliable in cases when blinds are stationary.

```js
      "webhook_port": 51828,
      "webhook_http_auth_user": "username",
      "webhook_http_auth_pass": "password",
      "webhook_https": false,
      "webhook_https_keyfile": "/path/to/https.key",
      "webhook_https_certfile": "/path/to/https.crt",
```

**NOTE**: For HTTPS users, there is a pending PR for self-signed certificates, which can cause the `ee key too small` error. See:  [selfsigned](https://github.com/jfromaniello/selfsigned/pull/35).

#### Receiving specific position (optional, ongoing basis)

`position_url` must report the current state of the blinds as an integer (0-100) in either plain text or JSON format, e.g. `{"current_position": 40}`. If JSON is used, JSON keys are filtered to look for a **single** numeric response, but the JSON handling is not very robust and will cause unexpected results if multiple numeric keys are present.

`position_url` defaults to a simple GET request, ignoring headers or other methods specified in `http_method`. If more robust handling is required, `position_url` can be defined as a complete `request`/`requestretry` object as specified in `Advanced URL` above.

If more robust handling of `position_url` responses in JSON format is needed, `position_jsonata` can be defined. This allows a [JSONata](https://jsonata.org/) expression to be set to parse the result. For example, considering the following JSON response:

```js
{
  example: { value: 4 }
}
```

If `position_jsonata` = `example.value`, this would produce the value of `4`. The [JSONata Exerciser](https://try.jsonata.org/) can be a helpful tool for developing custom expressions.

Ensure that the motion time is configured properly, even when `position_url` is set, as it is used to obtain an estimate of blind position to avoid multiple web requests to the `position_url`. (After the estimated position is reached, the position will be confirmed).

### Motion Time and Calibration
---

There are two time configurations parameters, `motion_down_time` and `motion_up_time`.        

`motion_down_time` is the time, in milliseconds, for your blinds to move from up to down.

`motion_up_time` is the time, in milliseconds, for your blinds to move from down to up.

The reason for this, is that there are some blinds that their opening time is different from closing time, due to simple physics - The weight of the shutter affects on the speed of the motor.  
Ideally, a better approach would be using some kind of gradual equation for calculating the exact time, according to the position, because the weight gradually added or subtracted during the move. But, hopefully this will be a nice to have feature in the future.

**NOTES**  
* These times above should only include the time the motor is running. Filming this with your phone to determine the time may be easier than trying to do it with a timer.
* If you are performing multiple blind requests simultaneously and are getting network timeouts due to your configuration, try using non-identical time duration (e.g., 9800, 10000, 10200 vs. 10000 for each) it may help.

**Steps:**
1. HTTP UP/DOWN request sent; wait for successful reply (i.e., `success_codes`) = `HTTP request delay (measured)`
2. Wait for device to send the signal to blinds, and movement begins = `response_lag`
3. Total motion time = `current_position` - `target_position`) / 100 * (`motion_up_time` or `motion_down_time`)
4. Send stop request (if needed) = `Total motion time` - `HTTP request delay` - `response_lag`
5. Wait for blinds to reach the target position = `Total motion time`

- The HTTP request delay is in the logs, i.e., `Move request sent (484 ms)` indicates the HTTP request took 484 ms.

- Using `response_lag` also helps ensure that if a move event is interrupted early, the position of the blinds will still be correct.

- Because the `HTTP request delay` in Step 1 can vary significantly (e.g., in the event of a failed request, it could be a few seconds), it is not included in the equation for Step 4. This is also shown in the Example below.

- The optional stop request needs to be sent *before* the blinds will actually reach the target position. This is because there is a delay (i.e., Steps 1 and 2) before a request is sent, received, and the corresponding signal sent.

Therefore, to calibrate your blinds, you will need to set `response_lag`. This can be a second or more in some cases. The simplest way to do this is to determine the time from initiating an open/close event via HomeKit to the time you can see/hear movement, and subtract the `HTTP request delay` (from the logs). This is only relevant when `trigger_stop_at_boundaries` is required, or, a value of 1-99 is used for the blinds (not just fully open or closed).

##### Example scenario (`motion_up_time` = 10000, `response_lag` = 750):

- 0.00 `Open` command sent
- 0.25 `HTTP request` successful (`Move request sent (250 ms)`)
- 1.00 Blinds moving...
- 10.25 `Stop` request sent
- 10.50 (est.) `HTTP request` successful
- 11.00 (Blinds should have stopped moving here, but `HTTP request delay` was ignored as mentioned above)
- 11.25 `Stop` command received by blinds, blinds stopped moving

### Manual Stop and Toggle buttons
---

These can be set to `true` or `false`, but the default is `false`.

- `show_stop_button` will expose a HomeKit button for the stop command. Some logic has also been added to smoothly abort any currently running functions.

- `show_toggle_button` will expose a HomeKit button that allows the blinds position to be toggled based on the last command sent. For example, if the last command sent to the blinds was `up`, it will send the command `down`. Note that on start up, `toggle` will have no effect unless either 1) the initial blinds position on start up is either 0 or 100, or, 2) at least one command (`up` or `down`) is sent.

### Special Cases
---

These can be set to `true` or `false`, but the default is `false`.

- `unique_serial` will use a uuid-based serial/model number instead of the default `BlindsHTTPAccessory`. This should only be required for specific external integrations (such as Eve) that may have problems with identical serial numbers for multiple devices.

- `use_same_url_for_stop` will send the previously sent url (either, `up_url` or `down_url`) again. This is for specific blind types that don't use a standard stop URL.

- `trigger_stop_at_boundaries` sends an additional stop command when moving the blinds to position 0 or 100.  Most blinds dont require this command and will stop by themselves.

- `verbose` adds additional logging capabilities.

## Specific configurations by manufacturer:

### Bond

- [Product Link](https://bondhome.io/)
- [Homebridge-Bond](https://github.com/aarons22/homebridge-bond)
- [Bond API](http://docs-local.appbond.com/)

Sample `config.json`, noting that you need to replace `1.2.3.4` with your Bond IP address, `<deviceId>` with your deviceId, and `<BondToken>` with your Bond token.

These values can be obtained from the Bond app, under `Device settings` for any individual shades.

```js
    {
      "accessory": "BlindsHTTP",
      "name": "Dining Room Shades",
      "up_url": "http://1.2.3.4/v2/devices/<deviceId>/actions/Open",
      "down_url": "http://1.2.3.4/v2/devices/<deviceId>/actions/Close",
      "stop_url": "http://1.2.3.4/v2/devices/<deviceId>/actions/Hold",
      "http_method": {
        "body": "{}",
        "headers": {
          "BOND-Token": "<BondToken>"
        },
        "method": "PUT"
      },
      "success_codes": [ 204 ],
      "motion_up_time": 11000,
      "motion_down_time": 10000,
      "response_lag": 1000,
      "trigger_stop_at_boundaries": false
    }
```

Alternatively, sample shell script to retrieve the list of Bond deviceId's using the local API, replacing `1.2.3.4` with your Bond IP address, and `<BondToken>` with your Bond token:

```sh
#!/bin/sh

# CONFIGURE BOND_IP AND BOND_TOKEN TO MATCH YOUR CONFIGURATION
BOND_IP="1.2.3.4"
BOND_TOKEN="<BondToken>"

if ! [ -x "$(command -v jq)" ]; then
  echo 'Error: jq is not installed.' >&2
  exit 1
fi

BOND_DEVICES=$( curl -s "http://${BOND_IP}/v2/devices" -X GET -d "{\"_token\": \"${BOND_TOKEN}\"}" | jq -r 'keys[]' | grep -v '_' )

while read -r line; do
   DEVICE_DETAILS=$( curl -sH "BOND-Token: ${BOND_TOKEN}" "http://${BOND_IP}/v2/devices/${line}" | jq '.name' )
   echo "${DEVICE_DETAILS} ${line}"
done <<< "${BOND_DEVICES}"
```

### Tasmota

- [Product Link](https://github.com/arendst/Tasmota)

Sample `config.json`, noting that you need to replace `1.2.3.4` with your Tasmota IP address. As described above, `%%POS%%` is used to supply the target position (0-100) to the plugin.

```js
    {
      "accessory": "BlindsHTTP",
      "name": "Window",
      "up_url": "http://1.2.3.4/cm?cmnd=ShutterPosition%20%%POS%%",
